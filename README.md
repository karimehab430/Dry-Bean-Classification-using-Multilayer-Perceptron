# Dry Bean Classification using Multilayer Perceptron

This project implements a neural network for classifying dry beans based on various physical features. The neural network uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture with backpropagation for training. The goal of this project is to use a neural network to classify dry beans based on their physical characteristics into one or more classes. The network is trained using backpropagation with either Sigmoid or Tanh activation functions.

The model can be customized with parameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and the number of neurons in each layer.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task is the Dry Bean Dataset which contains information about different dry bean classes based on their physical properties. The features include:

- Area
- Perimeter
- Major Axis Length
- Minor Axis Length
  
The target variable is the class of the dry beans.
